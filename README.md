# CCParentalControl

Cocos2d Parental Control for InApp purchases. If your application is marked for kids on the app store then you'll need to protect the app from mis-leading InApp purchases or external links. This is now a requirment from iTunes approval team.

The user will need to complete a mini quiz which consists of a single question. The user has 3 attempts to get the right answer. Also, the button needs to be pressed and held for 2 seconds.
